"""Plan native bubble shapes using neighboring sockets and placement frames.

The 2026-10-20 native unit-scale experiments bracket local roll recognition at
8 degrees passing / 10 failing, and socket gap at .075 passing / .100 failing.
These are measured brackets, not exact universal engine thresholds. Borderline
contacts are reported as uncertain. Scaled parts retain the older, narrower
supported envelope. Keep editor snapping tolerance separate from game contacts.

Preserve working native frames, including gradually twisted straight chains.
For independently oriented editor meshes, relabel each local frame using cube
symmetries; do not require one global frame. Only roll straights with unwanted
side contacts, using the measured working roll/gap envelope. Unit-scale
straights use six degrees so a single lateral contact clears the gap bracket.
