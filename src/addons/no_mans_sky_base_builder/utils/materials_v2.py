"""Colouring for the models-high-res asset library.

The old material system (utils/material.py) paints a part by swapping a flat
coloured material into slot 0. That works for the flat FBX proxies, but it
throws away the real game textures and it forces one material - and therefore
one mesh datablock - per (ObjectID, UserData) pair.

The high-res library works the other way round. Every colourable material in
models-high-res/assets carries an "NMS_Colourise" node group whose four palette
slots are Attribute nodes of type OBJECT, reading the object custom properties
nms_p / nms_s / nms_t / nms_q. So the colour lives on the OBJECT, not on the
material, and colouring a part is four property writes - no material is touched
and nothing has to be duplicated.

That is what makes the whole thing cheap: a thousand placements of the same
part share ONE mesh and ONE set of materials and can still each be a different
colour. Never copy a mesh or a material just to recolour something here.

UserData layout (the same bitfield utils/userdata.py already implements):

    colour index = UserData & 0xFFFFFF      bits 8, 16, 17 are reserved
    finish index = (UserData >> 24) & 0xFF  material/finish, not colour

The colour index indexes resources/colour_palette_by_index.json, extracted from
the game's own basebuildingobjectstable and cross-checked 84/84 against
resources/DT_Palettes.csv. The JSON is the wider of the two - all 151 palettes
with all four slots, against the CSV's 120 with two. The Cosmos update
appended STATION0..35 at 115..150 for the space station parts (palette group
STATIONBASE) and left every earlier index where it was.

The finish index is handled too, out of resources/finishes.json - but read
the note at the top of that file before trusting what it looks like. The finish
names are the game's, the surface values are ours.
